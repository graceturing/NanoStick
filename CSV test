''' This purpose of this program is to generate user names from a CSV file 
that contains data in 4 columns (last name, first name, 
an integer you can ignore, and an e-mail address).

1) The usernames should be formatted like this: 'first.last' (i.e. john.smith).

2) Usernames are all lower case.

3) People with compound first or last names should have the components
joined with a hyphen (i.e. shimel-binns)

4) Prefixes and suffixes (Jr, Dr., etc) should be discarded.

5) Other than the single ".", and possibly hyphens, user names have no
non-aphabetical characters in them.'''



# 1.) Import the CSV module 

import csv

# 2.) Create a variable named 'userNames'

userNames = csv.reader(open("members.csv","rU"))  # The reader method reads the contents of the csv. 


# 3) The usernames should be formatted like this 'first.last'. Use a FOR loop to do this:

for row in userNames:

     print '.'.join ([item.lower() for item in [row[index] for index in (1, 0)]]) # Here I add the '.' delimiter to be 
     # placed in between the 1st  & last names


# 4. To be continued....
