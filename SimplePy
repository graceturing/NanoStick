# This is a very simple program. All is does is take input from the user, and then 
# validates their input based on specified criteria.

# Step 1. I will import the time and math modules. The time module 
# is only used for effect; it can be omitted if need be.

import time 
import math 

# Step 2. I will name and define my global variables:

firstName = raw_input("What's your first name?")
lastName = raw_input("...and your last name?")
age = raw_input('How old are you?')
weight = raw_input('How much do you weigh?')

myList = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,age,weight]


# Step 3. User input is concatenated here, resulting in a printed string as output.

fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName

greeting = 'Welcome,' + ' ' + fullName + '!'

# Step 4. I'll define a function that validates the user's entry, such that 
# it will ONLY accept alphabetical characters. This function contains an IF/ELSE clause, and uses the .ISALPHA method:

def check_user_entry(fullName):
	if fullName.isalpha:
		print fullName
	else:
		print 'Sorry, but your name must contain alphabetical characters. Try again.'


print check_user_entry(fullName)


time.sleep(1.5) # Slight pause for effect; not critical.


# Step 5. I build upon the previous user input. This time, I will add an IF/ELIF/ELSE conditional:


def nameLength(fullName):
	if len(fullName) < 20 and fullName.isalpha:
		print '...man, that sure was a mouthful!!! It took all of' + ' ' + str(len(greeting)) + ' ' + 'characters just to greet you!!!'

	elif nameLength > 20 and nameLength != 30:
		print 'Wow. You really have a weird name.'

	else:
		print 'Meh.Your name is too short.Boo!'


print nameLength(fullName)


# Step 6. Finally, I will add a function which contains a FOR loop that iterates over the list "myList", and 
# prints the uppercase of each of its constituents. This list is defined at the beginning of the program.

def digits_in_myList(myList):
	for x in myList:
		if x.isalpha:
			print x.upper
		else:
			print none
